## Introduction
Student mental health has become a growing concern in higher education, with recent surveys indicating unprecedented levels of psychological distress. For example, a nationwide study of 33,000 college students found that half of students screened positive for depression and/or anxiety in late 2020 (Depression, Anxiety, Loneliness Are Peaking in College Students | The Brink | Boston University). These mental health difficulties can severely hinder students’ lives – reducing their quality of life, academic achievement, physical health, and satisfaction with the college experience (Consequences of Student Mental Health Issues – Suicide Prevention Resource Center). Given these stakes, it is crucial to understand how external pressures contribute to student mental health outcomes. College life often confronts students with multiple stressors, among which academic pressure, financial concerns, and social relationships are thought to play major roles. Academic stress is frequently cited as the dominant source of stress for students (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19), financial strain has been linked to higher risk of depression and anxiety, and social isolation or poor support networks can dramatically increase psychological distress (New Data Emphasizes the Correlation Between Loneliness and Student Mental Health - Active Minds). This study aims to examine how these three factors impact symptoms of depression, anxiety, and isolation in students. By quantifying their effects and interactions, we can better understand the nuances of student mental health and inform interventions to improve well-being and academic success.

The idea behind this project was to pay special attention to the mental health of students. Specifically, the tool hopes to identify students who may be higher risk in an attempt to make it easier for doctors to identify students at a higher risk. While this tool is not specifically designed to diagnose students with mental health disorders, it may aid doctors in diagnosing students. Ultimately this project is a tool, not a magic diagnosing device. The way that this project hoped to achieve success was to mimic the wellness survey at the start of most regular checkup visits and use this data to predict if students were at risk for mental health disorders. Specifically, I hoped to analyze how different external pressures affect different mental health disorders. For example, the survey asked about academic pressure, academic workload, financial strain, social relationships, etc, and I hoped to use this in order to not only predict risks of mental health disorders but also to identify correlations between certain pressures and mental health disorders.

In my initial planing stages of this tool was to figure out a way to standardize the user input (for example, a level 1 academic workload would be less than 3 hours of work a week outside of class). Ultimately I ended up scraping the idea because the tool is meant to act as a guage for how students feel and to better understand their perspective not to objectify their situation. For example, 2 students could be in the same classes, have the same amount of workload but student A finds it more stressful than student B. The survey would most likely reflect this by student A indicating a higher academic workload than studet B. As such, standradizing the survey would actually make thse two students appear the same when in reality it should attempt to identify student A as higher risk because they feel more stressed from courses. As such, the focus should be on measuring the percieved pressure and predicting the risk of mental health disorders. This kind of bias is called the self report bias where peaople misreport themselves in the survey data. This is a problem across all surveys however my tool hopes to leverage this bias in order to better understand the mental health of students.

## Methodology
The primary methodology for this tool is to act as a predictor for mental health disorders. As such, the tool will take user input and predict the risk of depression, anxiety, and isolation in students. This tool will use a linear regression model to predict the risk of mental health disorders. Specifically, the tool will use multiple linear regressions to evaluate each of the mental health concerns in the survey (Depression, Anxiety, Isolation, Future Insecurity). The tool only used certain columns from the survey. The columns used were:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- CGPA
- Residential Status
- Campus Discrimination
- Sports Engagement
- Average Sleep
:::
::: {.column}
- Study Satisfaction
- Academic Workload
- Academic Pressure
- Financial Concerns
- Social Relationships
:::

:::

And the dependent variables were:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Depression
- Anxiety
:::
::: {.column}
- Isolation
- Future Insecurity
:::

:::

The tool uses a random forest model to evaluate the risk of mental health disorders. This model uses the same columns as the linear regression model. The tool uses the linear regression models to generate a risk score for each mental health concern. To further evaluate the risk of mental health disorders, the tool uses the random forest model to identify important variables in the survey. Additionally, by analyzing the weights of each variable in the regression models, exploratory can be done to understand how different external pressures affect different mental health disorders. Additionally, there was some exploratory data analysis done to better understand the survey data distribution and correlations between variables.

### Data
#### Libraries and Tools
As most things data science in python, this project uses pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and seaborn. Pandas and numpy are different ways to better interact with csv's and math operations. Sklearn is used for the regressions and models covered in the later sections. Seaborn is a highly adaptable graph maker for python. 

```{python}
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
import seaborn as sns 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression 
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score
from sklearn import preprocessing 
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
```

#### Data Collection
The data used for this tool was collected from an online survey. The survey was taken from the website [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahashfaqvirk/student-mental-health-survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahashfaqvirk/student-mental-health-survey). This survey was a real suvey amongst students at PUCIT and asked participants about the following:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Gender
- Age
- University
- Degree Level
- Degree Major
- Academic Year
- CGPA
- Residential Status
- Campus Discrimination
- Sports Engagement
:::
::: {.column}
- Average Sleep
- Study Satisfaction
- Academic Workload
- Academic Pressure
- Financial Concerns
- Social Relationships
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Isolation
- Future Insecurity
:::

::: 


While not all of the columns were used in the tool itself, some of the columns were used in some exploratory data analysis for the survey data.

#### Data Cleaning
The bulk of the data cleaning came from converting the data into a format that could be used in linear regression. This involved converting categorical data to numerical data, removing unnecessary columns, and removing rows with missing values. 

Examples would be changing Male or Female to 1 or -1, reformatting tables to make them easier to read, and removing rows with missing values.

There were other things I did to clean the data which is dropping certain columns that were less relevant to my use case such as the University column. This is because the data itself only has roughly 90 entries and there is not enough of a variety of universities to draw any meaningful conclusions.

```{python}
#| output: false

dfall = pd.read_csv("data/MentalHealthSurvey.csv")

df = dfall.drop(['university', 'degree_level', 'degree_major', 'stress_relief_activities'], axis=1)

df =df.replace(to_replace="Male", value=1)
df =df.replace(to_replace="Female", value=-1)
df =df.replace(to_replace="1st year", value=1)
df =df.replace(to_replace="2nd year", value=2)
df =df.replace(to_replace="3rd year", value=3)
df =df.replace(to_replace="4th year", value=4)
df =df.replace(to_replace="0.0-0.0", value=0)
df =df.replace(to_replace="1.5-2.0", value=1)
df =df.replace(to_replace="2.0-2.5", value=2)
df =df.replace(to_replace="2.5-3.0", value=3)
df =df.replace(to_replace="3.0-3.5", value=4)
df =df.replace(to_replace="3.5-4.0", value=5)
df =df.replace(to_replace="Off-Campus", value=-1)
df =df.replace(to_replace="On-Campus", value=1)
df =df.replace(to_replace="Yes", value=1)
df =df.replace(to_replace="No", value=-1)
df =df.replace(to_replace="No Sports", value=0)
df =df.replace(to_replace="1-3 times", value=1)
df =df.replace(to_replace="4-6 times", value=2)
df =df.replace(to_replace="7+ times", value=3)
df =df.replace(to_replace="4-6 hrs", value=5)
df =df.replace(to_replace="2-4 hrs", value=3)
df =df.replace(to_replace="7-8 hrs", value=8)


x = df.drop(['depression', 'anxiety', 'isolation', 'future_insecurity', 'gender', 'age', 'academic_year'], axis=1)
```

### Regression Models
The regression tools used for this project were from the python library scikit-learn and the tool used 4 different linear regressions (one for eaach mental health concern). Specifically these were: Depression, Anxiety, Isolation, and Future Insecurity. On top of the linear regression, the tool also used random forest regression to identify important variables in the survey.

```{python}
#| output: false
depression = df['depression']
anxiety = df['anxiety']
isolation = df['isolation']
insecurity = df['future_insecurity']

dx_train, dx_test, dy_train, dy_test = train_test_split(x, depression, test_size=0.15, random_state=40)
ax_train, ax_test, ay_train, ay_test = train_test_split(x, anxiety, test_size=0.15, random_state=40)
ix_train, ix_test, iy_train, iy_test = train_test_split(x, isolation, test_size=0.15, random_state=40)
fx_train, fx_test, fy_train, fy_test = train_test_split(x, insecurity, test_size=0.15, random_state=40)

model_depression = LinearRegression()
rf_depression = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10, random_state=0, oob_score=True)

model_depression.fit(dx_train, dy_train)
rf_depression.fit(dx_train, dy_train)

model_anxiety = LinearRegression()
rf_anxiety = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10, random_state=0, oob_score=True)

model_anxiety.fit(ax_train, ay_train)
rf_anxiety.fit(ax_train, ay_train)

model_isolation = LinearRegression()
rf_isolation = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10, random_state=0, oob_score=True)

model_isolation.fit(ix_train, iy_train)
rf_isolation.fit(ix_train, iy_train)

model_insecurity = LinearRegression()
rf_insecurity = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10, random_state=0, oob_score=True)

model_insecurity.fit(fx_train, fy_train)
rf_insecurity.fit(fx_train, fy_train)

models = [model_depression, model_anxiety, model_isolation, model_insecurity]
y = [depression, anxiety, isolation, insecurity]
y_names = ["depression", "anxiety", "isolation", "future_insecurity"]
```

### Plots
For this section I will mainly focus on heatmaps and box plots to analyze correlations between specific variables and mental health issues. The dependent variable for these plots are the various mental health concerns measured in the survey (Depression, Anxiety, Isolation, Future Insecurity). Whereas there are a variety of independent variables that will be measured. Quick remind on how box plots work is that they plot the mean and their quartiles. The heatmaps display the mean of each coupled variable (example: average isolation score of women) and display the mean along a gradient. A darker color indicates a higher mean of mental score, whereas a lighter color indicates a lower score. 

```{python}

def get_box_plot(i):
    sns.set_theme(style="darkgrid")
    for m in y:
        plt.figure(figsize=(5,4))
        sns.boxplot(x=dfall[i], y=m)
        plt.show()

def get_heatmap(m):
  pivot = (dfall.groupby(m)[y_names].mean())

  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))

  sns.heatmap(pivot, annot=True, cmap="flare", fmt=".2f", cbar_kws={'label': 'Mean Value'})
  plt.title('Mental Health Factors by ' + m)
  plt.ylabel(m)
  plt.show()

```

### Formatting
This project was formatted using quarto which essentially is a more adaptable and advanced form of jupyter notebooks. As shown in this document, it allows for a well formated document containing various code blocks, html formatting options, and markdown compatability. For data science needs Quarto is almost a one stop shop for its wide use cases and adaptability. Additionally its compatable with a variety of IDEs such as VSCode, Neovim, and RStudio. I encourage anyone interested in data science endeavors to check out Quarto because it is quite powerful. 

## Results
### Tool
The actual implementation of the tool is quite simple. The code simply iterates through the different independent variables for the linear regression. At each iteration it asks the user for their score for each field. After it has collected the scores, the tool uses the collected user scores and the different linear regressions to determine the user's risk score. 

```{{python}}
#| output: false
x_names = x.columns

user_input = []

for name in x_names:
    user_input.append(int(input("Input for " + name + ":\n")))

user_input = np.array(user_input)

for i in range(len(y_names)):
    print("Predicted risk of " + y_names[i] +": ")
    print(models[i].predict(user_input.reshape(1,-1)))
```

#### Examples

:::{#example layout-ncol=2} 
![User Identified as Low Risk](images/LowRisk.png){width="70%"}

![User Identified as High Risk](images/HighRisk.png){width="70%"}
:::

#### Linear Regression Coefficients

```{python}
for i in range(len(x.columns)):
  print()
  print(x.columns[i])
  for model in models:
    print(round(model.coef_[i], 7), end="\t")
```

The above code simply iterates through each independent variable and prints out the coefficient for each linear regression. To read the output, the columns are (in order): depression, anxiety, isolation, insecurity. In general, higher magnitude of a coefficient indicates a stronger association between the independent variable and higher risk of mental health issues. Negative coefficients indicate a negative association between the independent variable and higher risk of mental health issues.

Now for actually analyzing the coeffecients, academic pressure and workload had the highest coeffecients indicating a higher weight for determining a students risk factor. For isolation, social relationships had the highest weight magnitude, specifically indicating that a poorer social relationship was associated with higher risk of isolation. This makes sense as isolation is often a result of feeling disconnected from those around you. As for future insecurity, the most important factor was study satisfaction. The coeffeecient in this case was negative, which means that a higher study satisfaction was associated with lower risk of future insecurity.

Most suprisingly to me was average sleep and sports engagement having some of the lowest coeffecients indicating a weak relationship bbetween these independent variables and the depedent variables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Here we can analyze a set of selected plots and draw conclusions based on the suvery data. Note that the code for these graphs are more clearly labeled in the [plots](#plots) section. Each plot was simply created by calling the `get_box_plot` or `get_heatmap` functions with the appropriate column name as an argument.

If you want to look at all findings for yourself visit the [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/Extr1n/DSCI330-Final-Project/blob/main/PyDoc.pdf) page. 


#### Gender
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| column: body
get_heatmap("gender")
```

According to the above heatmap, females tended to report higher levels of mental health concerns than men. However, the data only inclduded roughly 20 females and 70 males so I attributed these differences to small sample size of the original dataset.

#### CGPA
```{python}
#| column: screen-inset
#| echo: false
#| layout-nrow: 1
get_box_plot("cgpa")
```

According to the box plots, the students who reported the highest levels of mental health concern were students with GPA's between 1.5 and 2.0. However, students with the highest GPA's (3.5-4.0) tended to also have high levels of depression, anxiety, and isolation. The later is likely due to the fact that students with higher GPA's are more likely to have be under more stress to maintain their grades at this high level. The former is likely influenced from the stress of passing their classes. Whereas students with medium GPA's (2.5-3.5) overall had very average levels of mental health concerns. 

#### Average Sleep
```{python}
#| layout-nrow: 1
#| echo: false
get_heatmap("average_sleep")
```

This section clearly indicates that students who slept more reported lower levels of mental health concerns. This is likely due to the fact that students who sleep less are more likely to have been under greater stress due to a variety of factors such as staying up late to study, and not getting enough sleep.

#### Campus Discrimination
```{python}
#| column: screen-inset
#| layout-nrow: 1
#| echo: false
get_box_plot("campus_discrimination")
```

This section is also trivial with those who experienced campus discrimination reporting higher levels of mental health concerns than those who did not. This is likely due to the fact that students who were discriminated against were likely to have been under greater stress due to the discrimination.


#### Academic Pressure
```{python}
#| layout-nrow: 1
#| echo: false
get_heatmap("academic_pressure")
```

According to the heatmap, students who reported higher levels of academic pressure similarly reported higher levels of mental health concerns. Most probably due to the fact that this increased level of pressure attributed to higher levels of stress, thus higher levels of mental health concerns.

#### Academic Workload
```{python}
#| layout-nrow: 1
#| echo: false
get_heatmap("academic_workload ")
```

This heatmap also indicates that those who reported higher levels of academic workload were more likely to have reported higher levels of mental health concerns. Likely due to increased workload leading to higher levels of stress. However, for levels of isolation, there is little distinction between those who reported academic workloads between 2 and 4. Interestingly enough, those with the highest workload reported the highest levels of future insecurity, which should be the opposite of what we would expect.

#### Financial Concerns
```{python}
#| layout-nrow: 1
#| echo: false
get_heatmap("financial_concerns")
```

This heatmap indicates that only students with level 5 financial concerns reported higher levels of mental health concerns. This might suggest that financial concerns are only a major stress factor for students with the highest levels of financial concerns.

#### Social Relationships
```{python}
#| layout-nrow: 1
#| echo: false
get_heatmap("social_relationships")
```

The heatmap clearly indicated that those with poorer social relationships reported higher levels of mental health concerns. This might suggest that social relationships are highly beneficial for mental health. There is however a slight increase in mental health concerns for those with the highest levels of social relationships, which I attribute to uneven sample size of the original dataset as there were only 6 students that reported the highest level of social relationships.

#### Sports Engagement
```{python}
#| layout-nrow: 1
#| echo: false
get_heatmap("sports_engagement")
```

This heatmap indicates that students that participate in sports 4-6 times a month had the lowest levels of mental health concerns. This might suggest that sports engagement is a positive factor for mental health. However, those who reported 7 or more times of sports engagement had some of the highest levels of mental health concerns. These people might be student athletes who are required to put a lot of time and effort into their sport, thus leading to higher levels of stress. In general, students with no sports participations reported the highest levels of mental health concerns. This might suggest that while sports engagement is a positive factor for mental health, it can also become a stress factor after a certain point.


## Insights
### Impacts
First of all, the tool is able to correctly identify students who are at risk of mental health issues. This tool can be used to help identify students who are at risk of mental health issues and provide them with the resources they need. This tool can easily differentiate between low risk and high risk students which is quite useful. 

An interesting insight that can be derived from the exploratory data analysis is a stronger presence of catastrophizing in the high risk group. Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where people overly despair without an objective reason to (Psychology Today). In the heatmap found in the [Academic Workload](#academic-workload) section, it shows that students who are doing the most work reported the highest levels of future insecurity. This is counter intuitive because if one is doing more work, then this should reflect in the workplace and should be more secure in the future. However we find this is not the case in this group.

Similarly, students with the highest [CGPA](#cgpa) reported the second highest levels of mental health concerns (second to students with CGPA's between 1.5-2.0). In general, students with the highest GPA's should be feel more secure, however, the increased mental health concerns probably stem from increased stress to maintain a high CGPA. Take for example, a student with a 4.0 and a 3.4 GPA. The student with the 4.0 will likely be more stressed than the student with the 3.4 because a single "B" on their transcript would messup their 4.0 GPA. This might explain why students with the highest CGPA reported the second highest levels of mental health concerns.

Overall, Catastrophizing is very present in members of this data set as many students who should feel quite secure reported high levels of mental health concerns. Now unfortunately the tool does not have the ability to correct for this, however a survey like this could be used to identify students who are potentially catastrophizing and provide them with the resources they need. Professor Turner mentioned that this is a problem that can be addressed through positive psychology, which helps minimize the negative effects of catastrophizing by helping people learn how to shift their perspective of their reality. Positive psychology focuses on shifting one's perspective of their situation rather than fix the situation itself. For example, in this situation those with the highest academic workloads feel stressed and insecure and that is why they are constantly doing so much academically. Positive psychology would have these students understand that because they are doing a lot that they should feel more secure with their future lives, rather than try to relieve stress by having them take more or less work. This would help prevent those students from catastrophizing in the future.


### Problems
One of the biggest problems with this project is that overall the data set is quite small and not very diverse. In total the dataset included 87 participants with an overall skewed distribution for many different variables. This made it very difficult to draw accurate conclusions from the data.

Another massive flaw in this project is the social desirability bias. Simply this means that a person will answer the survey in a way to make them appear more "normal" and avoid any potential consequences of seeming undesirable. What this would look like in this survey is a person reporting that they sleep 8 hours a night and have a social life that they consider normal, but in reality, they have a poor sleep schedule and social life. This would lead to this person going unnoticed and not receiving the help they needed. 

Due to the biases mentioned above the tool has trouble identifying students who are at risk of mental health issues and choose to hide this info. This is true in the real world with doctors who are not able to identify students who are lying to be percieved as normal. Thus, the actual benefits of this tool are limited because doctors can already identify students who are at high risk of mental health issues. The main issues lie in students who are at medium risk and students that lie to be percieved as normal.
