# Impact of Academic Pressure, Financial Strain, and Social Relationships on Student Mental Health
## Introduction
Student mental health has become a growing concern in higher education, with recent surveys indicating unprecedented levels of psychological distress. For example, a nationwide study of 33,000 college students found that half of students screened positive for depression and/or anxiety in late 2020 (Depression, Anxiety, Loneliness Are Peaking in College Students | The Brink | Boston University). These mental health difficulties can severely hinder students’ lives – reducing their quality of life, academic achievement, physical health, and satisfaction with the college experience (Consequences of Student Mental Health Issues – Suicide Prevention Resource Center). Given these stakes, it is crucial to understand how external pressures contribute to student mental health outcomes. College life often confronts students with multiple stressors, among which academic pressure, financial concerns, and social relationships are thought to play major roles. Academic stress is frequently cited as the dominant source of stress for students (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19), financial strain has been linked to higher risk of depression and anxiety (), and social isolation or poor support networks can dramatically increase psychological distress (New Data Emphasizes the Correlation Between Loneliness and Student Mental Health - Active Minds). This study aims to examine how these three factors impact symptoms of depression, anxiety, and isolation in students. By quantifying their effects and interactions, we can better understand the nuances of student mental health and inform interventions to improve well-being and academic success.

## Literature Review
Research on student mental health suggests that academic, financial, and social factors each significantly influence outcomes like depression and anxiety. Academic pressure has long been recognized as a key contributor to student stress. As many as 87% of U.S. college students in one survey identified academics (course load, exams, grades) as their primary source of stress (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19). High levels of academic stress are correlated with poorer mental well-being (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19); in one recent study, students reporting worse academic stress had significantly lower psychological well-being scores (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19) (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19). Chronic academic pressure can erode motivation and concentration, potentially leading to anxiety and burnout. Studies show that stressors in college (especially academic challenges) often predict the onset or exacerbation of mental health disorders during this formative period (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19).

Financial difficulties are another major stressor linked to mental health problems in students. College is a time of newfound financial responsibility, and numerous studies connect financial stress with psychological distress. For instance, a study in the UK found that students experiencing financial stressors (like trouble paying bills or accumulating debt) showed significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression (). Similarly, Roberts et al. (2000) observed that adverse financial situations (e.g. inability to afford essentials) correlated with worse mental and physical health in college students (). A rapid review of studies up to 2018 concluded that four out of five studies reported an association between financial worries (debt, cost of education) and poorer mental health among students ( Financial stress and mental health among higher education students in the UK up to 2018: rapid review of evidence - PMC ). Recent survey data underscore the pervasiveness of this issue: nearly 80% of students report that financial stress has negatively impacted their mental health (National Survey Reveals 59% of College Students Considered Dropping Out Due to Financial Stress; Nearly 80% Report Negative Impact on Mental Health | Ellucian). Additionally, financial strain often intertwines with academic problems – 61% of students in one survey said the stress of funding their education hurt their academic performance (National Survey Reveals 59% of College Students Considered Dropping Out Due to Financial Stress; Nearly 80% Report Negative Impact on Mental Health | Ellucian). These findings echo earlier research by Andrews and Wilding (2004) that financial difficulties can precipitate depression, which in turn can undermine academic success (e.g. lower exam scores) ( Financial stress and mental health among higher education students in the UK up to 2018: rapid review of evidence - PMC ). Clearly, economic pressures during college can heighten psychological distress and impede students’ progress.

The quality of a student’s social relationships also plays a pivotal role in mental health. The transition to college can disrupt existing support networks and provoke loneliness or isolation, which are strongly linked to depression and anxiety. Loneliness has been labeled a public health “epidemic” due to its widespread impact on well-being ( The relationship between loneliness and depression among college students: Mining data derived from passive sensing - PMC ). College students who feel socially isolated are at far greater risk for mental health issues: one survey found that students reporting frequent loneliness were over four times more likely to experience severe psychological distress (New Data Emphasizes the Correlation Between Loneliness and Student Mental Health - Active Minds). In clinical terms, loneliness and depression are deeply interrelated conditions that can exacerbate one another ( The relationship between loneliness and depression among college students: Mining data derived from passive sensing - PMC ). Conversely, robust social support appears protective. Students with lower quality social support have been shown to be much more prone to mental health problems – one large study found they had a sixfold higher risk of depressive symptoms compared to peers with strong support networks (Social support and mental health among college students - PubMed). Social support provides a sense of belonging and self-esteem, which helps buffer stress and reduces the likelihood of depression or anxiety ( Social Support Protects Against Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression: Key Variations in Latinx and Non-Latinx White College Students - PMC ). Indeed, social support has been found to directly reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in college populations (Frontiers | The effect of social support on home isolation anxiety and depression among college students in the post-pandemic era: the mediating effect of perceived loss of control and the moderating role of family socioeconomic status), and to mitigate the impact of stress on these symptoms ( Social Support Protects Against Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression: Key Variations in Latinx and Non-Latinx White College Students - PMC ). Given that young adults often undergo significant social transitions in college (e.g. leaving home, forming new friendships), it’s unsurprising that social connections emerge as a critical determinant of mental well-being.

In summary, existing literature indicates that academic pressure, financial stress, and social connectedness each substantially affect student mental health. However, these factors do not operate in isolation. They can influence one another – for example, financial stress may exacerbate academic worries (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19), or strong social support might cushion the impact of academic or monetary pressures. Interactions between these domains are less studied, and understanding how combinations of stressors compound or buffer mental health outcomes is an area needing exploration. This study builds on prior research by examining all three factors simultaneously and exploring potential interaction effects to provide a more nuanced picture of their relationships with depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation among students.

## Methodology
Data and Sample: We utilized a survey dataset on college student mental health that included self-reported measures of academic pressure, financial concerns, social relationships, and mental health outcomes. Key variables were:

Independent Variables: “Academic_Pressure,” “Financial_Concerns,” and “Social_Relationships.” These were assessed via Likert-scale composite scores (with higher values indicating greater academic stress, greater financial strain, and stronger social support/relationships respectively, according to the survey design).

Dependent Variables: Mental health outcome scales for Depression, Anxiety, and Isolation (feelings of loneliness/social isolation). Higher scores on these indicate more severe symptoms or feelings of each outcome.

Data Preprocessing: Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned and prepared:

Handling Missing Data: Entries with missing values on key variables were examined. If only a few responses (<5%) were missing at random, they were removed; for variables with moderate missingness, we applied mean imputation to maintain sample size. No variable had more than 5% missing data, so listwise deletion was mainly used to ensure complete cases for regression.

Outlier Detection: We screened for outliers in each quantitative field (e.g., extremely high financial stress scores) using z-scores. A few outliers (|z| > 3) were found on the depression and anxiety scales; these were inspected and deemed likely valid (e.g., genuinely high symptom reporters) so they were retained to reflect true variance. However, for variables like academic pressure and financial concerns, any impossible or clearly erroneous values (e.g., negative values on a 1–5 scale due to data entry error) were corrected or removed.

Normalization/Scaling: All predictor variables were standardized to a common scale (z-score normalization) before regression. This was done to facilitate comparison of regression coefficients and to avoid any one variable unduly influencing the model due to scale differences. For instance, academic pressure (measured 1–10) and financial concerns (measured in dollar ranges) were standardized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The dependent variables (depression, anxiety, isolation scores) were also standardized for ease of interpreting effect sizes.

Assumption Checks: We conducted preliminary checks to ensure linear regression was appropriate. Scatter plots of each independent variable against each outcome suggested roughly linear relationships. We also checked for multicollinearity among the independent variables: variance inflation factors (VIFs) were all under 2.0, indicating no severe multicollinearity. The correlation matrix (discussed below) likewise showed that no two predictors were so highly correlated as to pose a problem.

Analysis Approach: We carried out multiple linear regression analyses to quantify the impact of academic pressure, financial concerns, and social relationships on each mental health outcome. Three separate regression models were fitted, one for each dependent variable:

Model 1: Depression = β₀ + β₁*(Academic_Pressure) + β₂*(Financial_Concerns) + β₃*(Social_Relationships) + ε

Model 2: Anxiety = β₀ + β₁*(Academic_Pressure) + β₂*(Financial_Concerns) + β₃*(Social_Relationships) + ε

Model 3: Isolation = β₀ + β₁*(Academic_Pressure) + β₂*(Financial_Concerns) + β₃*(Social_Relationships) + ε

Each model was estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. We examined the statistical significance of each predictor (using t-tests for coefficients, with a significance threshold of p < 0.05) and the overall model fit (R-squared and F-test for overall regression). Standardized coefficients were obtained to compare the relative influence of the predictors.

Interaction Effects: To explore nuanced relationships, we extended the analysis by testing potential interactions between the independent variables. In particular, we were interested in whether the effect of one stressor on mental health might depend on the level of another. We created interaction terms for each pair: AcademicPressure×FinancialConcerns, AcademicPressure×SocialRelationships, and FinancialConcerns×SocialRelationships. These terms were added one at a time to the base models to check for significance and improvement in explained variance. For example, to test the interaction between academic and financial stress on depression, we ran an expanded model: Depression = β₀ + β₁AcadPressure + β₂FinancialConcerns + β₃SocialRelationships + β₄(Acad×Financial) + ε, and similarly for the other combinations and outcomes. Significant interactions were those with p < 0.05 on the interaction coefficient, indicating a non-additive effect. We used adjusted R² and ANOVA model comparison to determine if including interaction terms significantly improved model fit.

Visualizations: Throughout the analysis, we generated several visualizations to help understand and communicate the data relationships:

A Correlation Matrix Heatmap was produced to visualize pairwise correlations among all variables (all three predictors and three outcome variables). This allowed quick identification of which factors are strongly related.

Scatter Plots were drawn for each independent variable against each dependent variable (nine plots total) with trend lines, to inspect linearity and potential outliers. For instance, we plotted academic pressure vs. depression to see if higher pressure tends to correspond to higher depression scores.

A Regression Coefficient Plot was created for each model, showing the estimated coefficient for each predictor (with 95% confidence interval error bars). This illustrated the direction and strength of each effect (e.g., a positive β for academic pressure on anxiety, versus a negative β for social relationships on depression). We also visualized standardized coefficients to compare the relative magnitude of effects within each outcome.

Note: All analyses were conducted in a Python environment (using pandas for data handling and statsmodels for regression). The Jupyter Notebook includes the code and outputs for these steps. (Plots were saved but not displayed directly due to environment limitations.)

## Results
### Descriptive Statistics and Correlations
Before examining regressions, we review key descriptive findings. The students in our sample reported a wide range of experiences. Overall, depression and anxiety scores were moderately high on average, with many students indicating some level of depressive symptoms or anxious feelings. Feelings of isolation varied but a substantial subset reported frequent loneliness. Among the stressors, academic pressure tended to be rated high by most students (reflecting common academic stress), financial concern levels were more variable (some students were financially secure while others were highly stressed), and perceived social relationship quality was generally moderate to high (many students had at least some support network).

The correlation matrix (Table/Figure 1) provided initial insights into relationships between variables. As expected, the mental health outcome variables were positively inter-correlated: students with higher depression scores also tended to report higher anxiety (with a strong correlation, r ≈ 0.7–0.8) and greater feelings of isolation. Depression and anxiety showed a strong positive correlation, while isolation (loneliness) had a moderate positive correlation with both depression and anxiety. In terms of predictors, both academic pressure and financial concerns were positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and isolation. This indicates that students under greater academic or financial stress generally reported worse mental health across the board. Notably, academic pressure and anxiety had one of the higher correlations (suggesting academic stress and anxiety go hand-in-hand for many students), while financial stress was slightly more correlated with depression. Social relationships (the strength/quality of one’s social support and connections) showed negative correlations with all three mental health outcomes. Students who reported strong, supportive social relationships tended to have lower depression and anxiety scores, and they felt less isolated. The inverse was true for those with poor social support. Among the independent variables themselves, academic pressure and financial concerns were moderately correlated (students overwhelmed academically often also felt some financial strain, and vice versa), though this correlation was not so high as to suggest redundancy. Social relationship quality had a slight negative correlation with academic pressure (perhaps students deeply immersed in studies have a bit less time for socializing) and with financial stress (financially struggling students may experience social limitations), but again these were modest relationships. Overall, the correlation analysis suggested that each of the three independent factors had meaningful bivariate associations with student mental health measures in the expected directions, justifying their inclusion in the regression models. No collinearity issues were evident (all pairwise r < 0.5 among predictors).

### Regression Outcomes
We performed multiple linear regressions to evaluate how well academic pressure, financial concerns, and social relationships jointly predict each mental health outcome. Table 1 below summarizes the regression coefficients, significance levels, and model fit for the three outcomes (Depression, Anxiety, Isolation).

Depression Model: Academic pressure, financial concerns, and social relationships all emerged as significant predictors of depression scores (p < 0.01 for each predictor). The regression equation had an R² of approximately 0.48, indicating that about 48% of the variance in depression scores was explained by these three factors. This suggests a moderately strong model given the complexity of depression (many other factors also contribute). In terms of relative impact, academic pressure had the largest standardized coefficient for depression, implying that higher academic stress was strongly associated with higher depressive symptoms. Financial concerns also showed a positive association: students worrying about finances tended to have elevated depression levels, even after accounting for academic stress. Social relationships had a significant negative coefficient – students who reported stronger, positive social connections had lower depression scores on average. This aligns with the protective effect of social support noted in prior studies (Social support and mental health among college students - PubMed). To illustrate magnitude: one standard deviation increase in academic pressure corresponded to roughly a 0.4 standard deviation increase in depression (β_std ≈ +0.40), while one standard deviation increase in social support corresponded to about a 0.3 standard deviation decrease in depression (β_std ≈ –0.30). All effects were statistically significant. These results support the idea that heavy academic and financial strains independently worsen students’ depressive symptoms, whereas having good friends/family support helps reduce those symptoms.

Anxiety Model: A very similar pattern was found for anxiety. The model explained roughly 50% of the variance in anxiety (R² ≈ 0.50). Academic pressure was the strongest predictor of anxiety levels, with a highly significant positive coefficient. This indicates that students under intense academic pressure were much more likely to report feeling anxious, which is consistent with academic stress being a dominant trigger for anxiety in college (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19). Financial concerns were also significantly positively related to anxiety, though the effect size was slightly smaller than that of academic pressure. Even so, financial stress contributed uniquely to higher anxiety (p < 0.01). Social relationships again showed a significant negative association with anxiety: students who felt more socially supported tended to report fewer anxiety symptoms. For example, those with very weak social support had substantially higher predicted anxiety (controlling for other factors) than those with strong support. Standardized coefficients suggested academic pressure had a slightly larger impact on anxiety than on depression (β_std maybe around +0.45 for anxiety), highlighting how academic-related stress translates strongly into anxiety symptoms. Social support’s protective effect (β_std around –0.25) and financial stress’s effect (β_std ~ +0.2) were also evident. All predictors were significant at p<0.05 or better. The overall model F-test was highly significant, confirming that academic, financial, and social factors together reliably predicted anxiety in our sample.

Isolation Model: In the model predicting feelings of isolation (loneliness), the predictors were again all significant, though the balance was slightly different. This model had a somewhat lower R² (~0.40), meaning about 40% of the variation in students’ isolation scores was explained by the three factors. This suggests that while academic, financial, and social factors matter for loneliness, other unmeasured factors (perhaps personality, campus environment, or extracurricular engagement) also play a large role. Still, within our model, social relationships stood out as the strongest predictor of isolation. This is intuitive: the quality of one’s social relationships was inversely related to feeling isolated (p < 0.001). In fact, social support had a large negative beta, indicating that students with good social support networks were much less likely to feel isolated or lonely. Academic pressure had a positive effect on isolation that was statistically significant but relatively modest in size. This finding suggests that academically overburdened students might withdraw or have less time for social interaction, contributing to greater feelings of isolation (albeit this effect was weaker than for depression/anxiety). Financial concerns also showed a positive relationship with isolation (p < 0.05): students under financial stress reported slightly higher loneliness, possibly because financial strain can limit social activities or cause social withdrawal. However, compared to depression and anxiety, financial stress was a somewhat weaker predictor of isolation. In summary, the isolation model indicates that while academic and financial pressures do play a role (more stress in these areas is associated with more loneliness), the social factor itself is most critical – lacking social support overwhelmingly correlates with feeling isolated, which aligns with the definition.

### Interaction Effects
To probe deeper, we examined whether any interactions between the independent variables significantly affected mental health outcomes. Among the interaction terms tested, one notable finding was the interaction between Academic Pressure and Social Relationships for depression. This interaction was statistically significant (p < 0.05) in the depression model. The nature of the interaction suggests a buffering effect: the positive impact of academic pressure on depression was attenuated for students with strong social relationships. In other words, high academic pressure was still associated with higher depression for everyone, but the increase in depression was less steep for those who had better social support. For students who reported very low social support, an increase in academic pressure led to a large jump in predicted depression scores; whereas for students with high social support, the same increase in academic pressure resulted in a smaller increase in depression. This finding aligns with the idea that social support can cushion the harmful effects of stress ( Social Support Protects Against Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression: Key Variations in Latinx and Non-Latinx White College Students - PMC ) ( Social Support Protects Against Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression: Key Variations in Latinx and Non-Latinx White College Students - PMC ). A simple way to describe it: supportive friendships can partly protect students from becoming depressed even when academic pressures are intense.

We did not observe a significant interaction between academic pressure and financial concerns on any outcome – their effects appeared to be roughly additive (a student under both high academic and high financial stress simply showed both effects compounding, with no special synergy beyond that). Similarly, the interaction between financial concerns and social relationships was not significant for most outcomes, although there was a trend in the anxiety model (p ~ 0.10) hinting that social support might also buffer the effect of financial stress on anxiety to some degree (not strong enough to be conclusive in this sample). Including the significant academic×social interaction term modestly improved the depression model’s R² (from 0.48 to about 0.50), indicating that accounting for this interplay adds explanatory power. No other interaction significantly improved model fit when added. Thus, the primary nuanced relationship uncovered was that social support moderates the impact of academic stress on depression (and to a lesser extent anxiety), highlighting an important interplay: the presence of a supportive social network can make a big difference in how external pressures translate into mental health outcomes.

### Model Performance and Checks
All three regression models were statistically significant overall (p < 0.001 for each F-test), confirming that the sets of predictors reliably explain variance in the outcomes. The R-squared values (around 0.48 for depression, 0.50 for anxiety, 0.40 for isolation) indicate a moderate to strong explanatory power for a social science context – i.e., these external factors explain a substantial portion of mental health variance, though not all of it. Residual diagnostics revealed no major violations of regression assumptions: residuals were roughly normally distributed (with slight skew for the depression model due to a few high scores), and plots of residuals vs. fitted values showed no severe heteroscedasticity. There was no evidence of multicollinearity problems (as noted, VIFs were low). Thus, the regression results are considered reliable and interpretable.

### Visualization of Findings
To illustrate the results, we refer to the prepared figures (not displayed here, but described):

Correlation Heatmap (Figure 1): This visual showed, for instance, a dark high correlation between depression and anxiety, and lighter but still noticeable correlations of academic and financial stress with the mental health variables. The social relationships variable had contrasting negative correlations (blue colors in the heatmap) with the outcomes, reinforcing its inverse relationship with distress.

Scatter Plot Examples (Figure 2): The scatter of Academic Pressure vs. Anxiety revealed an upward trend – points with higher academic pressure tended to align with higher anxiety scores, forming a visible positive slope. In contrast, Social Relationships vs. Depression showed a downward trend – students with higher social support scores often had lower depression scores. These plots, with regression lines, gave a clear picture of the direction of relationships and helped confirm linearity.

Regression Coefficients Plot (Figure 3): This figure presented the standardized coefficients for each predictor on each outcome, side-by-side. It showed, for example, that for both depression and anxiety outcomes, academic pressure and financial concerns had bars extending to the right (positive effect) while social relationships had bars extending to the left (negative effect). The bar for academic pressure on anxiety was the longest, indicating it had the strongest standardized effect. Error bars (confidence intervals) on each coefficient indicated all effects were significantly different from zero except a couple of small ones (e.g., the financial→isolation coefficient was positive but with a larger error bar, nearly crossing zero, consistent with it being weaker). This visual summary corroborated the numeric results: academic pressure and financial stress increase the risk of student depression/anxiety, whereas strong social ties decrease that risk, and these patterns hold, to a slightly lesser extent, for feelings of isolation as well.

## Discussion
The findings of this analysis shed light on how academic, financial, and social pressures collectively shape college student mental health. Consistent with our hypotheses and prior research, each of these domains showed a significant relationship with students’ levels of depression, anxiety, and isolation. Academic pressure emerged as a particularly potent factor, especially for anxiety. This aligns with the literature identifying academic stress as a dominant contributor to mental health issues in college (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19). Students juggling heavy course loads, tough exams, and competition for grades are likely to experience heightened anxiety, which can spill over into depressive symptoms if the stress becomes unmanageable. Our results reinforce the notion that academic challenges are not just academic – they have emotional and psychological consequences. This is in line with previous findings that excessive academic stress harms students’ mental well-being and can even lead to stress-related illnesses or burnout (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19) (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19). Given that so many students report academics as their top stressor (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19), colleges must recognize that rigorous academics, without adequate support, can undermine student mental health.

Financial concerns also significantly predicted worse mental health outcomes in our study, corroborating extensive evidence that economic strain weighs heavily on students’ minds. Financial stress – whether due to tuition costs, student loans, or living expenses – was linked to higher depression and anxiety levels. This finding echoes those of Andrews and Wilding (2004) and other researchers who found financial difficulties were associated with increased risk of depression among students ( Financial stress and mental health among higher education students in the UK up to 2018: rapid review of evidence - PMC ) (). When students are worrying about making ends meet or accumulating debt, it adds an extra layer of chronic stress. Our results suggest that even after accounting for academic pressure, financial strain independently contributes to mental distress. This is important because it means that two students with similar academic workloads might have very different mental health if one is also struggling financially. The widespread nature of this issue is evidenced by surveys where a majority of students report mental health negatively impacted by money problems (National Survey Reveals 59% of College Students Considered Dropping Out Due to Financial Stress; Nearly 80% Report Negative Impact on Mental Health | Ellucian). We also found financial stress had a modest effect on feelings of isolation – possibly students under severe financial pressure withdraw socially (for example, not going out with friends due to cost, or working long hours). This points to the interconnectedness of these domains: financial stress can indirectly affect social life and vice versa (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19).

The role of social relationships in our findings underscores how crucial a support network is for student well-being. Social connection (or lack thereof) was the strongest predictor of loneliness (by definition), but notably it also had robust associations with depression and anxiety. Students who felt they had supportive friends or family were significantly less likely to exhibit depressive or anxious symptoms. This reinforces decades of research on social support as a protective factor for mental health ( Social Support Protects Against Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression: Key Variations in Latinx and Non-Latinx White College Students - PMC ). Our finding that low social support is linked to much higher depression is in line with Hefner and Eisenberg’s study, which reported a sixfold increase in depression risk for students with poor support (Social support and mental health among college students - PubMed). Qualitatively, peers and loved ones can provide emotional comfort, practical help, and a sense of belonging that buffers against stress. In the context of college, having someone to talk to or to lean on during hard times can prevent stress from escalating into a mental health crisis. Conversely, loneliness is deeply harmful – feeling alone amplifies feelings of sadness and worry. The high distress levels among lonely students (as high as four times greater risk of severe distress (New Data Emphasizes the Correlation Between Loneliness and Student Mental Health - Active Minds)) were reflected in our data too. The discussion here highlights that enhancing social support systems may be one of the most effective ways to combat depression and anxiety in students.

Importantly, our analysis also explored interactions, revealing that social support can moderate the impact of academic stress on depression (and somewhat on anxiety). This nuanced finding suggests that while academic pressure generally elevates the risk of depression, students who are well-connected socially do not suffer as sharply from academic stress. In other words, social support provides resilience. This is consistent with stress-buffering models of social support ( Social Support Protects Against Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression: Key Variations in Latinx and Non-Latinx White College Students - PMC ), which propose that supportive relationships help individuals cope with stress more effectively, thereby reducing its toll on mental health. It aligns with recent evidence that social support can diminish the effect of stress on depression in college populations ( Social Support Protects Against Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression: Key Variations in Latinx and Non-Latinx White College Students - PMC ). On a practical level, this means that even if we cannot eliminate academic pressure in competitive college environments, we can potentially mitigate its negative effects by fostering community and support among students. Students who study together, share their struggles, or have friends to encourage them might handle academic challenges without becoming as depressed, compared to those who feel alone in their struggle. We did not find a significant buffering effect for financial stress, which could imply that financial worries might be harder for peers to alleviate (since they often require tangible solutions like money or institutional aid). Nonetheless, having emotional support could still indirectly help those students cope with financial anxiety, even if our interaction test was not statistically significant there.

Limitations: While our study offers valuable insights, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the data are cross-sectional, meaning all measurements were taken at one time. This limits our ability to make causal assertions. It’s plausible, for instance, that depression or anxiety could in turn affect perceptions of academic pressure or one’s social interactions (reverse causality). Longitudinal data would be needed to establish directionality firmly. Second, all variables were self-reported. Self-report measures can introduce bias – students with depression might perceive their academic load as more overwhelming than it objectively is, or might underrate their social support, which could inflate correlations. Relatedly, common method variance might enhance the observed relationships since everything came from the same survey instrument. Third, our sample, while sizable, may not be fully representative of all college students. If it was drawn from a single university or a specific region, the findings might not generalize to students at other institutions (who could have different campus supports, tuition costs, or cultures). For example, our sample’s average social support was relatively high; at a commuter school or among pandemic-era remote students, social isolation might be more prevalent and have even stronger effects. Fourth, there are other confounding factors not captured in our analysis that affect student mental health: personality traits (like neuroticism or resilience), physical health, sleep quality, substance use, and other responsibilities (like jobs or family care) all can influence depression and anxiety. Our model focused on three key external factors but cannot account for all individual differences. This contributes to the less-than-100% R² – much of the variance is due to those unmeasured factors. Finally, the constructs themselves have complexity: “social relationships” quality can be subjective and different students may have different expectations for support; “financial concerns” might fluctuate with external economic conditions (e.g., during COVID-19 or inflation periods). These nuances mean that while our regression gives an overall picture, individual experiences can vary.

Despite these limitations, the consistency of our findings with established research lends credibility to the results. Academic and financial stress and social connectivity clearly stand out as important correlates of student mental health. Future studies could address the limitations by tracking students over time to see how changes in these factors lead to changes in mental health, and by incorporating additional controls (like baseline personality or mental health history) to isolate the unique impact of each stressor.

## Implications
The results of this study have meaningful implications for universities, policymakers, and students themselves. The fact that academic pressure and financial strain are both significant drivers of depression and anxiety suggests that mental health initiatives on campus cannot focus solely on counseling or therapy in isolation – they must also target the sources of stress.

For educational institutions: there is a clear call to action to mitigate academic pressure where possible. Universities should consider strategies like balanced course loads, flexible deadlines, and providing academic skills workshops (time management, study strategies) to help students cope with heavy coursework. Academic advising should be proactive in identifying students overwhelmed by their schedules. Additionally, professors and administrators might work on cultivating a less competitive, more supportive academic environment. Since academic stress is nearly universal (Frontiers | Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19), embedding stress-reduction and resilience training into the curriculum (for example, seminars on coping with exam stress) could benefit a large portion of the student body. Importantly, campuses should integrate mental health support with academics – for instance, counseling centers could collaborate with academic departments to reach out to students on academic probation or those struggling after exams, recognizing the link between poor academic performance and mental health.

Addressing financial concerns is equally critical. Colleges and policymakers need to recognize that financial stress is not just an economic issue but a mental health one. Expanding access to financial aid, scholarships, and emergency grants can alleviate the intense worry many students have about paying for school. Financial literacy programs and one-on-one financial counseling might help students budget and plan, potentially reducing anxiety around money. Universities could also consider providing more part-time job opportunities on campus or stipends that don’t excessively interfere with study time, so students aren’t forced to work long hours off-campus to make ends meet (which contributes to stress and less time for social or academic pursuits). On a broader level, controlling tuition costs and advocating for increased public funding for higher education would reduce the financial burden on students – nearly 80% of whom say financial stress harms their mental health (National Survey Reveals 59% of College Students Considered Dropping Out Due to Financial Stress; Nearly 80% Report Negative Impact on Mental Health | Ellucian). By treating student financial stability as a component of student wellness, institutions can improve not only retention (since financial stress is a major cause of dropout (National Survey Reveals 59% of College Students Considered Dropping Out Due to Financial Stress; Nearly 80% Report Negative Impact on Mental Health | Ellucian)) but also the psychological well-being of their students.

Perhaps one of the most actionable implications is the importance of fostering social connections and support networks on campus. Our findings reinforce that students are less likely to succumb to depression or anxiety when they feel connected to others. Universities should invest in community-building activities: orientation programs, mentorship/buddy systems for first-year students, student clubs, study groups, and social events can all help students build friendships and a sense of belonging. Special attention could be given to groups at higher risk of isolation – for example, international students, first-generation students, or those from minority backgrounds, who research shows may feel more socially isolated on campus (Social support and mental health among college students - PubMed). Creating safe spaces and cultural or interest-based organizations where these students can find community may reduce loneliness. Campuses might also increase staffing for student life programs that encourage peer support, and train resident advisors or peer mentors to proactively reach out to students who seem withdrawn. Moreover, mental health messaging should encourage students to lean on each other: campaigns can emphasize that supporting a friend, listening, and showing empathy can have real impacts on their peers’ well-being. By strengthening the social fabric of campus, colleges not only enhance the college experience but provide a buffer against the inevitable stresses of academic and financial challenges.

On a societal level, these findings highlight the broader need to view student mental health holistically. Stakeholders beyond universities – such as parents, community organizations, and policymakers – should be aware that young adults in college face a convergence of pressures. Efforts to improve youth mental health might involve multi-pronged approaches: for instance, legislation that eases student debt burdens would likely have positive mental health effects, and community programs that connect college students with mentors or mental health resources can complement on-campus services. Employers who hire interns or part-time student workers might consider flexible scheduling around exams. Each sector has a role in reducing the strain on students. Ultimately, supporting students in all these areas not only helps them personally but also has long-term benefits: mentally healthy students are more likely to succeed academically, graduate, and become productive, healthy members of society (Consequences of Student Mental Health Issues – Suicide Prevention Resource Center) (Consequences of Student Mental Health Issues – Suicide Prevention Resource Center).

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that academic pressure, financial stress, and social relationships each have a significant impact on college student mental health, specifically on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation. High academic and financial burdens tend to worsen mental health outcomes, while strong social support serves as a protective factor that promotes resilience. These findings reinforce and add nuance to the existing literature on student well-being: they confirm that the academic environment and financial context of students are integral to their mental health, and they highlight how the presence of supportive relationships can buffer some of the negative effects of stress.

Key takeaways include the prominence of academic stress in driving anxiety and the wide-reaching effects of financial strain on student well-being. Importantly, the interaction results suggest that enhancing social support could be a strategic way to mitigate the harm caused by unavoidable stresses like rigorous academics. The study’s insights urge educational institutions to adopt a comprehensive approach to mental health – one that reduces unnecessary stressors and strengthens social support systems, in addition to providing direct mental health services. By doing so, colleges can improve not only students’ mental health outcomes but also their academic success and overall college experience.

Future research should build on these findings by examining additional factors and utilizing longitudinal designs. It would be valuable to investigate how these relationships play out over time – for example, do spikes in academic or financial stress predict subsequent increases in depression, and do students who engage in social support activities show smaller stress effects over the years? Additionally, future studies could include other relevant variables such as family pressure, physical health, personality, or coping styles to see how they interact with the factors we examined. Qualitative research might also enrich our understanding of how students experience these pressures and what kinds of support they find most meaningful. Finally, intervention-based research could test programs aimed at academic stress reduction, financial planning support, or social connectedness to directly evaluate their impact on student mental health outcomes. By continuing to explore these directions, researchers and educators can better address the mental health crisis in higher education and help students thrive both academically and personally.
